First App! 2023/11/02
---------------------------------
My first Java app was uploaded here on Nov 2nd, 2023 at 21:54. Let's do this!!! :D

Hello World! 2023/12/17
---------------------------------
Hello World updated.

Phone Book! 2023/12/17
---------------------------------
We were asked to make an app with 3 options: 1) Add new entry 2) Print whole phone book 3) Exit program.
I added another option to delete an entry and I almost spend 7-8 hours on it. It's OK but whenever "deleteContact" method is called, 4-option menu is printed twice.
