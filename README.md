Hello World! 2023/12/17

Hello World updated.

Phone Book! 2023/12/17
---------------------------------
We were asked to make an app with 3 options: 1) Add new entry 2) Print whole phone book 3) Exit program.
I added another option to delete an entry and I almost spend 7-8 hours on it. It's OK but whenever "deleteContact" method is called, 4-option menu is printed twice.

Phone Book updated; Problem solved. 18:13

Start Object-Oriented Phone Book! 2023/12/24

Customers Application! 2024/01/13
---------------------------------
After two weeks I remade my application and now I have a limited customer application.
I tried to search all fields but I could do it just for parent class (Customer).
How can I search LegalCustomer & RealCustomer fields?
